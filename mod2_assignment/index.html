                <p>
                    HTML is an acronym for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a static language that determines the structure and semantic meaning of a web page. You use HTML to create content and metadata that browsers use to render and display information. HTML content can include text, images, audio, video, forms, lists, tables, and many other items. An HTML page can also contain hyperlinks, which connect pages to each other and to websites and resources elsewhere on the Internet.

                <h3>Overview of CSS</h3>
                <p>
                    CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS provides the standard way of defining how a browser should display the contents of a web page. CSS enables you to attach presentation rules to fragments of HTML based on selectors that target HTML elements by name, id, or class. It also enables you to vary how a page is presented according to the form factor of the device on which it is displayed, from a large monitor to a smartphone, and even on an audio reader or printer.

                <h3>Overview of JS</h3>
                <p>
                    JavaScript originated as a programming language in the 1990s and has steadily evolved. The standard upon which it is based, ECMA-262, is frequently updated and augmented. Consequently, the JavaScript engines used in modern browsers are now exponentially faster and more functional than their predecessors. At its heart, JavaScript is a scripting engine with the same basic features as any other programming language.
